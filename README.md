Diligent full stack developer skilled at planning and completing high-quality work. Experience in creation, revision and optimization for web applications with detailed attention to logic and workflows at each step. Highly analytical and well-organized with expertise in testing and verifying completed programs. Proficient in many front-end and back-end languages, databases, and best code practices that I utilize in creating web applications.
My recent experience with Revature included a lot of hands-on activities/challenges and projects using a large variety of technologies; from both the Front and the Back-end including but not limited to; HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, and Angular, Java, SQL, Spring ecosystem, and Microservice.
Revature has also been a great opportunity for me with great exposure to a large panoply of technologies from the basics, CI/CD of Git and Jenkins to the complex containerized microservices architecture.
What Iâ€™m looking for today is a new opportunity with a company where I can contribute and have a positive impact with my passion of helping others to solve complex problems in the digital industry, in fact automation today is affecting a lot of jobs/ industries; there are so many Tech companies that are really disrupting the way things are done. As a Software developer instead of being afraid about what the future may hold, I get to be a driving force toward the future of innovation; to me this is a huge privilege and a really exciting one!
